YOU ARE IN `slab` BRANCH NOW, don't trying to run or even to compile anything.

This is project to add new features from linux kernel 2.6.11 (as the 
book `Understand The Linux Kernel` considers) which I consider simple 
and interesting to xv6.

TODO LIST:
buddy system -> finished kalloc.c {TODO: replace kalloc & kfree in other files}
wait queue -> finished semaphore.c {TODO: more general code i.e. replace sleep and wakeup}
atomic ops -> finished atomic.h {just COPY AND PASTE current linux kernel arch/riscv code}
smp wait -> IN_TEST {w/o IPI support, just let clock intr handler do this}
disable preemption -> IN_PROGRESS {TODO: preempt_enable w/o schdule and preempt_disable}
slab allocation -> IN_PROGRESS
signal
NUMA (interesting, yet I'm not interested in implementation)

Notes:
  How to add a syscall?
  step 1: In syscall.h, add a macro 'SYS_xxx'
  step 2: In syscall.c, add a fn declaration 'extern uint64 sys_xxx(void)'
  step 3: Also in syscall.c, add an entry in syscalls '[SYS_xxx] sys_xxx'
  step 4: Implement 'sys_xxx' in the according c file
  step 5: Add 'entry(xxx)' in usys.pl
  step 6: Add declaration in user.h

  why smp_function_call need interrupt on?
    This fn need to grab call_lock, which may grabing by others now. To let others release
    the lock. In linux, this cpu need to handle the IPI. In xv6, this cpu need the clk
    intr handler. If we disable intr, neither of this would happen.

  why atmoic_t is 'struct { volatile int; }' and why preempt_enable and disable need
  barrier?
    Sometimes we want compiler generate code in order, where we can use 'volatile' or
    'barrier()'. In atomic_t case, variable access should NEVER be optimized. And in
    preempt case, only when we enable or disable preemption, we need let the compiler
    be stupid. So they are different tools to do the same thing.

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)).  See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/, which provides
pointers to on-line resources for v6.

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu).  The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.1810, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu.  Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".
